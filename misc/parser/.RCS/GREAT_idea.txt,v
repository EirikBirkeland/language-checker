@Those words that are complete unambiguous will serve as core words.
They will be beacons in the dark.

Here are 10 such words:

Jeg - determiner, 1st person

Jeg er sulten.
DET 1st, present tense v√¶re, adjective sulten

Sulten var uutholdelig.
    past verb adj

CORE WORDS in google texts can be found by matching a corpus against the big list, and then those words that only exist in one class, will become core words.

then there will be 2nd tier 3rd tier 4th tier, depending on how many possible interpretations there are.
