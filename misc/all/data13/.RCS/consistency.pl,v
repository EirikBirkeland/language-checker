    First, find source segments that are identical by first
	   * getting the length of all segments
	   * matching the actual contents of those segments (any number)
	Second, if 2 source segments are identical
	   * check that the corresponding target segments are identical as well.
         Bonus:  output all segments for comparison with highlighting for differences, where the odd one out (in the case of many segments) has its differing parts highlighted.
