# <untitled> - a bilingual translation file checker

Back in 2015, I wanted to simplify my Google Translator Toolkit --> Xbench language checks. So I came up with a solution where I could just download XLIFF files from GTT and have them auto-checked with a HTML report output.

This script has not been maintained since 2015.
